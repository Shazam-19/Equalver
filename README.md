# Equalver

Equalver is an advanced mathematical equations calculator with a friendly user interface 
and functionality to help the user interact with it easily.

- User Friendly GUI
- Solve complex equations in less than a second!
- ✨Magic ✨

To Download the Application file use this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DTTqz2lnBarjfwJPsjxdRrSlh4xBJG2Y/view?usp=sharing).

## Features

- Write an equation in a normal way without the need to specify each multiplication (e.g. **2+4x** instead of 2+4*x).
- Solve Bisection, False Position, Simple Fixed Point, Newton, and Secant-Methods. 
- Export the solution to an _csv_ file to easily copy and modify the answer.

## Tech

Equalver uses a number of open source language and it's libraries to work properly:

- [Python] - High-Level Programming language for anything on your mind!
- [Sympy 1.10.1] - Symbolic mathematics are easier with this masterpiece.
- [Tkinter 8.6] - Python's de-facto standard GUI.
- [Matplotlib 3.5.1] - A cross-platform, data visualization and graphical plotting.
- [CSV 0.0.13] - CSV (Comma Separated Values) format, is a type of files to import and export spreadsheets and databases.
- [Pillow (PIL) 9.0.1] - Add image processing capabilities to the program.

And of course Equalver itself is open source with a [public repository][dill] on GitHub.

## Development
